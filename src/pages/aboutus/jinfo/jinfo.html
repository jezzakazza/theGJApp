     J from GJ writes all the music for GJ's live songs. His guitar wizardry has amazed all and he often has to reject offers to feature
     in other artists' songs. J can play many instruments but he chooses guitar because it is the most attractive.
     Nobody has a poster of Pete Fountain on their wall. Google him. It is safe to assume countless walls are 
     decorated with the image of J from GJ.
